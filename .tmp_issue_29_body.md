Status: Initial Textual app scaffold exists in `src/cocode/tui/app.py` (`CocodeApp`). This issue now tracks implementing the minimal base layout.

Scope
- Define base layout: header/status bar and split panes (e.g., agents list / logs)
- Wire composition in `compose`/`on_mount` and basic keyboard navigation skeleton
- Structure ready for follow-ups (#30–#37) without major refactor

Acceptance Criteria
- Launching shows a header and two panes without runtime exceptions
- Layout code is isolated/clean to support later components
- (Optional) Add a brief dev note on how to run the TUI in docs or the issue

Out of Scope
- Detailed components (diff viewer, tabs, summaries) and advanced interactions — tracked separately.
